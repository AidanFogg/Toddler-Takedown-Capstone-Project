# Toddler-Takedown-Capstone-Project

Welcome to my capstone project, Toddler Takedown! 

I built this app from the ground up using javascript html and css. 

The packages I installed were: express, cors, and axios.

This was a really great learning experience and I had a lot of fun building out the different features. My favorite part was figuring out how to create a popup with a
hyperlink to redirect users to my "terms and conditions". We never really learned any of that in our class and it was jumping out of my comfort zone a bit but I found 
some awesome tutorials online and found out some cool ways to manipulate css in my javascript file which I had no idea was possible. 

Before starting this class I had no coding experience at all so all of this has been a very steep learning curve and quite stressful for me but it's starting to click
little by little and It's been a blast making things like this and seeing code that I've written perform how I imagine it after a long process of trial and error. 

Hope you enjoy this silly app as much as I do!

p.s. this idea came from an inside joke between my little brother and I. I have nothing against toddlers and would never do anything to endager one.
